# Welcome to My First Post

This is my first blog post on this Hugo site that's been configured with:

- **Hugo** - The world's fastest static site generator
- **Vite** - A modern build tool for web development
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - A utility-first CSS framework with Vite integration

## Features

### Modern Development Setup

The site uses Vite to process CSS assets with Tailwind CSS 4, providing:

- ⚡ Lightning-fast development server
- 🎨 Modern CSS with utility classes
- 📱 Responsive design out of the box
- 🚀 Optimized production builds

### Hugo Integration

The integration between Hugo and Vite allows us to:

- Use Hugo's powerful content management
- Leverage Vite's modern build pipeline
- Get the best of both worlds for static site development

## Next Steps

This is just the beginning! You can:

1. Create more content using `hugo new content posts/new-post.md`
2. Customize the Tailwind CSS configuration
3. Add more layouts and sections
4. Deploy to your favorite hosting platform

Happy building! 🎉
